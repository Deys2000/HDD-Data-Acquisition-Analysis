# HDD-Data-Acquisition-Analysis
Used Windows CMD to acquire comprehensive set of directories and files from local Computer Hard Drive applying heavy parsing techniques with Python to clean static in data to produce CSV files 800,000 rows in length. Data set was too large for regular spreadsheet programs, so I leaned to use Tableau and produced several graphs that displayed detailed insights into the information stored in my Computerâ€™s Hard drive.
